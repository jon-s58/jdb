## Success Criteria

By the end of this roadmap, JDB should be able to:

1. **Store and retrieve data reliably** with ACID guarantees
2. **Execute complex SQL queries** with good performance
3. **Handle concurrent users** safely
4. **Recover from crashes** without data loss
5. **Scale to reasonable datasets** (millions of rows)
6. **Integrate with existing tools** via PostgreSQL protocol
7. **Provide administrative tools** for database management
8. **Offer production monitoring** and debugging capabilities

## Notes

- Each phase builds on the previous ones
- Testing should be continuous throughout development
- Performance benchmarking should start early (Phase 3)
- Documentation should be updated with each major feature
- Consider contributing to open source database projects for learning
